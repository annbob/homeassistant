- split global_config up in multiple files to make addons possible

I had actually intended to move over completely with my header to CH, however I need exceptions to recreate this which made it highly unstable for use with the way I intend to show it. It works for a short period of time where it would bug, hang and reconnect/disconnect after changing to another view. After testing this for almost a week I consider it not usable in its current state and I will keep my custom header in place.
The header would load up faster with CH, but the actual view would take much much longer and sometimes you had to press 2 to 10 times before it would actually go to the desired view. I reverted to the original way I had introduced it last week and with the new fixes this setup should run very smooth on your device (given the device is not ancient ofc).

Enjoy!

All info below is only meant for users of the Alpha version. If you haven't installed this yet you don't need this information!
Note for users from the Alpha version:
- if you made changes to views, please make a backup!
- copy all the contents from the lovelace folder to your own (best would be to just delete your old one to make sure no things are left behind)
- copy the global_config folder to the root of your install, your old file will no longer work properly, please convert your setup to the new style. If you have already done some work on this you can simply copy it over to the new files (BE CAREFUL, some items might have moved on or two rows, remember to keep the exact order!)
- copy the `/themes/` folder and copy it over your old ones (This is IMPORTANT)
- change the path to your global_config folder inside of `configuration.yaml` to ```lovelace_gen: !include_dir_merge_named global_config/```
- you will not need to redo your groups! only the global_config will need to be redone, all the group files have remained unchanged!

Extra Note for 2 or 4 person households:
You can now choose which frontpage you want to use, you can choose between the following layouts:
1. default (which is the 2 large photo's and the smaller photo in the middle)
2. 2-persons (this is 2 large photo's without the middle photo)
3. 4-persons (4 large photo's)
4. 4-persons (2 large and 2 smaller photo's)

Please copy the correct frontpage from the addons view (you can find how to do this in the documentation which has been updated for this). In case of 4 persons you should also copy the fourth person input_select and automation (which are now default for new users) and you will need to fill in the global_config/addon folder.
