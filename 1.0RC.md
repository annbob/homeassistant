Homekit Infused v.1.0 RC

Hello all, it is finally here, Homekit Infused 1.0 Release Candidate. For all people that were holding off to install this because of the alpha/beta tags will be happy to know that this is essentially the final 1.0 version.
If any change will come along soon it will only be minor changes. Alpha and Beta users please read the notes at the bottom.

Changes and Fixed:
- MASSIVELY simplified docs for HKI 1.0 Release Candidate (it is now easier to install this than ever! Yay)
- moved config to packages which makes installing a LOT easier (see documentation)
- completely rewritten global config
- global_config is now fully commented out, when commented it will choose defaults (finally it is much easier to configure and edit HKI)
- fixed some popups that would show on all devices instead of the current device
- added option to change sorting method of the auto filled views
- frontpage is now fully configurable through the global_config
- changed badges to be more flexible, it can now also be used for other states (see screenshots)
- fixed alignment of icons in the picture-elements on the frontpage
- fixed some missing icons on some views
- added all views and a ton of new options to global_config
- header icons can now be changed
- as requested, buttons on the devices view can now have custom popups again like in HKI 0.13.x and lower (by replacing the more-info window like legacy popup cards do).
- fixed thermostat button, it should now show more colors for different states and should now work with both climate entities that use either state or hvac_action! (thanks to all of you for showing me your climate entities to make this possible)
- added fans to climate view (it uses a new group, beta users see info below)
- fixed vacuum view, colors and buttons broke in the last beta
- minor fixes to themes, the default HA theme is now a selectable option! (beta users see info below)
- split up the menu in categories, it is now easier to use the main menu!
- themes now use the same style as HACS themes, this makes it possible (theoretically) to use HACS themes as well
- removed all unused input_selects which are no longer needed
- the current method of global_config makes it possible to have user submitted views available for you in the future, it is very modular and it is easy to create new views and/or use different views because of the way global_config is written now. If you'd like to submit a view to be added to HKI please read the guidelines in the documentation.
- minor fixes
- emtpied Remote Control view (will be released throughout the week as an addon as it only works for Apple TV atm)

Notes for alpha and beta users:
If you are using the alpha I highly recommend you to reinstall instead of updating (though updating is possible by reading my guides)
If you use the beta, I would actually also recommend you to do this, however updating can be done in two ways.

#### Method 1 (this is the preferred and most future proof method)
Step 1: Remove all related config from the previous HKI install (this means ALL `automations`, ALL lines related to this in `configuration.yaml` ALL `input_selects`, ALL `input_booleans` etc. etc.) You can leave things like `custom-ui` if you had that and `browser_mod:`.
Step 2: Follow the steps from the renewed documentation. It now uses packages which makes it SUPER easy for me to update the project in the future for you without the need for you editing those files. Amazing ey? Well this was exactly what I was aiming for almost a year ago and I think I finally did it.

#### Method 2
Step 1: Replace the following folders: `/global_config/` and `/lovelace/` and `/themes/`. The easiest method would be to simply delete the old files and folders and then copy the new files.
Step 2: you will need to add the `all_fans` group to your groups file.
Step 3: you have to change `configuration.yaml` and change the line which has themes in it. Change it to `themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes/`. 
Step 4: the automations related to themes have changed, please copy the new automations over your old ones.

The group files remain unchanged except for the new fan_group. If you have made changes to any of the views, I suggest you to copy the config and paste it back into the new one. ALL views and global config MUST be replaced!!!
Yes I know it has changed once again, but remember you are/were running either an alpha or beta version and that is bound to change often. However I do have some good news this time. The global config is exaclty as I want it to be now and I will NOT change this any time soon!
If you had been holding off to install HKI because of the beta nature then you will be happy to know that this is most likely the same version as the actual 1.0 release, hence the name RC. Only minor changes will be done (if needed).
From now on updates will also be possible with the guides you were already used to if you were using HKI in 2019. The major difference is that firstly I won't have to write as much of information due to the way that HKI is written now and secondly it is much and much easier to update than ever!


Once again, thanks for all your support and patience. We are going to have great fun this year and the modularity of the current HKI makes for a great start of 2020. Enjoy!!
