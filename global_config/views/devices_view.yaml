# Global Config for Homekit Infused 2020

# Devices View

# How to use?
# To edit a view open one of the global config files to the corresponding view. Editing views can be done simply by editing this file!
# ALL items are commented! This is done because commented items will revert to the default configuration. The default configuration is
# set up by myself. It tries to show as much of the interface as possible without the need for you to edit the views. You will ofcourse
# want to set it up yourself. Using it this way makes it possible to only change what you want to change. E.g. You only want to change
# the icons on the buttons of the frontpage? Well you will only need to uncomment the item in the list below and put in your own config!

# Before you continue I will recommend you to use VSCode as a text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Header
devices_header:
  title: Devices
  icon: fal:light-switch-on

# Button Sorting (you can choose either between: domain, entity_id, name, state, last_changed, last_updated or last_triggered.)
devices_sorting:
  method: name

# Popup (change the template to `button_standard_behavior.yaml` if you want to use custom popup cards, 
devices_popup:
  fan_group: button.yaml
  devices_group: button.yaml

# Lock (puts a lock on buttons and you will have to press twice, the first tap will unlock, the second tap will toggle the button.)
devices:
  living_room_lock: false
  bedroom_lock: true
  office_lock: true
  kitchen_lock: false
  laundry_lock: false

# Config
# The devices config is done through a template and groups. To make the devices view work, make sure that you have filled the hki_groups.yaml
# file. Without those groups this view will not work!
