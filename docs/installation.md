# INSTALLATION
Installing HKI can be quite an undertaking as you will need a lot of custom-cards and custom-components. I will try to guide you through on how to go at this.

### Prerequisites
  - First create github account if you do not already have one
  - Then install HACS (https://github.com/hacs/integration) Please read the documentation on how to do this, I will not make docs on things that are already perfectly documented.
  - After HACS is installed and configured you will need to install a list of custom-cards. There are two ways to do this. Either copy all the contents of the `/www/community/` folder to your own `/www/community/` folder. This will not allow you to update the addons in the future. Or find them in the HACS community store, this method is preferred and allows you to update addons in the future.

The following addons are needed and can be found in the HACS plugin store!
You won't need to add them to the resources file as I have already done this for you.

Manual Plugins Installation. The following plugins can either not be found on the HACS store or are modified by me. The best way to install these are to copy the corresponding files into your `/www/community/` folder. Do NOT get them from HACS!!

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|----------------------------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Components (click on Integrations in HACS)

| Name | Required | Description |
|----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Browser Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) | Yes | Browser-mod makes the browser more useful and gives us the opportunity to show/create custom popups and many more, make sure you have `browser_mod:` in your `configuration.yaml` after you have installed it. Click the link for instructions! |
| [Lovelace Gen](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-lovelace_gen) | Yes | This is the MOST important piece of the setup, without this HKI will not work! Don't add this to your `configuration.yaml` file as the included package already does so for you, if you already have `lovelace_gen:` in your `configuration.yaml` please remove or comment that line! |
| [Average Sensor](https://github.com/Limych/ha-average) | No | This sums up the number of any of your entities and creates an average sensor of it, I use this on the climate view and frontpage. Not required, but you must have some kind of replacement if you don't use this, I recommend you to install it though, do not forget to set it up after installing |
| [Plex Recently Added](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.plex_recently_added) | No | This works in conjunction with the Upcoming Media plugin, this is only useful if you use Plex |
| [Sonarr and Radarr Upcoming Media](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.radarr_upcoming_media) | No | This works in conjunction with the Upcoming Media plugin, this is only useful if you use Sonarr or Radarr |

Manual Components Import. The following components can either not be found on the HACS store or are modified by me. The best way to install these are to copy the corresponding files into your `/custom_components/` folder.

| Name | Required | Description |
|----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Imap | No | This is a modified imap component, you should only install this when using outlook/live or hotmail email addresses |
| RDW | No | This is a sensor for Dutch APK, if you are not a Dutch citizen this is useless to you |

# Copying
### Notes
- For safe results I suggest restarting Home Assistant at this point.
- After having installed all the required components and custom-cards it is now time to copy files over, remember that you should have made BACKUPS by now, if you haven't DO IT NOW!!! Past this there is nothing else I can do for you if you fail to do a simple task!

### Copy Files
To copy the files you will need all the following files/folders from my repo.

- Copy the entire `/lovelace/` folder to the root of your setup
- Copy the `/themes/` folder to the root of your setup
- Copy `ui-lovelace.yaml` file to the root of your setup
- Copy the `/packages/` folder to the root of your setup
- Copy the `/global_config/` folder to the root of your setup
- Copy the `/www/images/` folder to your own `/www/` folder
- Add the following line to your `configuration.yaml` file
```
homeassistant:
    packages: !include_dir_named packages/
```
Note: If you have an existing setup and already have packages, you must cut/paste the packages folder inside your currently exising packages folder! (depending on the way the folder is included within your configuration.yaml file)

- This will already work if you have used HACS for themes in the past, but to be safe add the following line to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```
frontend:
    themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes/
```

- You must set the following line in your own `configuration.yaml` file. Without it, it will NOT work!
```
lovelace:
    mode: yaml
```

- Now choose your layout. You have the choice between the following frontpage layouts: (screenshots soon!)
1. Default (two large photos with device tracker and sensors, and a smaller photo in the middle with device tracker only)
2. 2-persons (two large photos with device tracker and sensors)
3. 4-persons (four large photos with device tracker and sensors)
4. 4-persons (two large photos with device tracker and sensors, two photos with device tracker only)
- If you have chosen your layout, please do the following: Copy the chosen template from the `/addons/views/` folder (found on the repo) to your `/lovelace/views/` folder. You MUST remove the `00.frontpage.yaml` file which comes by default! If you just wish to use the default you can skip this step!

Note: you can't have duplicate keys, this means that you can't have either the exact same config twice. This is mostly important for users coming from the alpha or beta versions of this setup. If you did run the beta and want to update, you MUST remove EVERYTHING that was related to the alpha/beta (this means, views, global_config, automations, input_selects, etc, etc). Don't forget anything. (if you can't remember what those files were, you can simply download the beta release from the repo and see which files were in there). HKI config is now packaged for easy updates. This also means that keeping the old automations etc would mean duplicate keys!

The copying process should now be completed and we can move on to the configuration part.

I am pretty sure you are already quite some time at this, maybe you should take a break now? XD!
