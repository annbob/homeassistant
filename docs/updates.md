# Updates and Addons
## Updates
When you don't edit any of the views, includes and templates you can easily update this install! All you would need to do is copy my new files over your old ones.

## Addons
This project will get addons in the form of new views and/or templates which can be imported into the setup whenever you would need or want it.
Addons come in two ways, firstly as a view, secondly as a global_config file. The two files will be used in tandem for the addons and are not and will never be required for the base setup to work.
If you want to use the addons you simply copy the new view to your `/lovelace/views/` folder and the corresponding global_config file to your `/global_config/addons/` folder.

If you like to create addons for this project and want to share them, please learn how to use global_config with lovelace_gen (my entire setup is based off that principle, so it should be relatively easy to learn). Submit a view and global_config and I will add your addons to the addon list on this repo. (ofc it will be credited properly)
